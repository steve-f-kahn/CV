## Projects
| Project            | Overview                                                          | Tech Stack                  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------:|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/acebook-team-pocket)|A 4 person project over 2 weeks to try to replicate facebook. A big challenge, alot of fun. First rails app, lots learnt over 2 weeks from git flow to active record. |Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, RSpec, Travis CI, HEROKU, Agile|
|[MakersBnB](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/Makersbnb)|Build a clone of AirBnB in a week with 3 other people. Learn a new tech stack on top, a bit too much. However, I learnt a huge amount when building this. About the tech stack and my first group project in a tech team. Having to learn so much meant alot of talking to the team and explaining concepts as well as learning off others. We grew massivily and collabritively. |Javascript, JQuerry, Express, Node.js, SQL, Cypress|
|[Thermostat](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/thermostat)| A single page app that adjusts temperature. It interacts with API's to get temperature and store previous setting.  | Javascript, JQueery, Jasmine, Ruby, Sinatra, Rspec, SQL |
|[Airport Challenge](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/Airport_Challenge_Python)| A simple model of an aiport built using TDD and with OOD in mind. This was built in a couple mornings from picking up python for the first time to finished product. Demonstrates my ability to take on new content at quick pace and build with it. | Python, Unittest |

## Skills
### Problem Solve

I love solving problems. 

#### Communication

I'm a prize winning public speaker and have regularly presented. At makers I paired daily, led stand ups and retros in my group projects. At Renishaw I presented my work to fellow engineers at design meetings and results of projects to seniors. At university I lead presentations on group design projects to peers and professors. At school as head of Army as part of the combined cadet force I regally taught a group of 20+ boys. I also won the public recitation competition.

### Learn Quickly

I can adapt to knew challanges and take on the information I need to know. During one week at makers I was able to pick up two new languages, javascript and python,and develop projects in them using completely new testing frameworks. I made a AirBnB clone using node with no prior experience in a week. 

### Analytical Thinker

During my time at makers I took part in process workshops where I watched others code and broke down their process in detail. Proceeding to look where it could be improved to help us become better developers. I completed the [gilded rose project](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/gilded_rose_design_project) where I took someone elses code, understood it, refactored it again and again, breaking down where it could be improved and how. 


#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)


## Experience
