|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------:|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/acebook-team-pocket)|A 4 person project over 2 weeks trying to replicate facebook working in sprints using agile methodology. A big challenge, alot of fun. First rails app, lots learnt over 2 weeks from git flow to active record. |Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, RSpec, Travis CI, HEROKU|
|[MakersBnB](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/Makersbnb)|Build a clone of AirBnB in a week with 3 other people. Learn a new tech stack on top, a bit too much. However, I learnt a huge amount when building this. About the tech stack and my first group project in a tech team. Having to learn so much meant alot of talking to the team and explaining concepts as well as learning off others. We grew massivily and collabritively. |Javascript, JQuerry, Express, Node.js, SQL, Cypress|
|[Thermostat](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/thermostat)| A single page app that adjusts temperature. It interacts with API's to get temperature and store previous setting.  | Javascript, JQueery, Jasmine, Ruby, Sinatra, Rspec, SQL |
|[Coonect 4](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/deep_red_yellow_connect4)| A machine learning connect 4 game built in 2 weeks for my Makers final project. We made extensive use of documentation to learn lots of new content as noone in the team had any experience of machine learning, although lots of enthusiam to learn it. I built the game from scratch using TDD. I solved problems such as making the game run as fast as possible by writing an algorithim checking who won by looking at winning combinations that only included the last move. Presented the project at demo day as seen here: [presentation](https://www.facebook.com/MakersAcademy/videos/1034352356758922/?t=1828)|Python, Pytest, Tensorflow, Keras, OpenAI Gym |
## Skills
### Problem Solving

I love solving problems. From [code wars](https://www.codewars.com/users/steve-f-kahn) to the projects I worked on everyday at makers and the side projects I continue to work on. A challenging problem I recently solved was how to write a fast algorithim to check if you had won in connect 4. By only checking if the last move had made a winning combination of moves with your list of moves the computer was able to play the game quickly. It could then learn to play the game in a reasonable time frame to be demonstrated at demo day.

#### Communication

At Makers I pair programmed daily, led stand ups and retros in my group projects. At Renishaw I presented my work to fellow engineers at design meetings and results of projects to seniors. At university I lead presentations on group design projects to peers and professors. At school as head of Army as part of the combined cadet force I regally taught a group of 20+ boys. I also won the public speaking competition.

### Learn Quickly

I can adapt to knew challanges and take on the information I need to know. During one week at makers I was able to pick up two new languages, javascript and python,and develop projects in them using completely new testing frameworks. I made a AirBnB clone using node with no prior experience in a week. 

### Analytical Thinker

During my time at makers I took part in process workshops where I watched others code and broke down their process in detail. Proceeding to look where it could be improved to help us become better developers. I completed the [gilded rose project](https://github.com/steve-f-kahn/gilded_rose_design_project) where I took someone elses code, understood it, refactored it again and again, breaking down where it could be improved and how. 

## Experience

**RENISHAW** (JULY 15 to JUNE 16)    
**Industrial Placement** 7 months work in mathematically modeling sensors using matlab. My first major introduction into coding. I presented the results of my work and the how I achieved them back to the team and my seniors. 5 months of mechanical design work heavily reliant on CAD.
